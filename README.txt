The Czech UD treebank is based on the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0 (PDT),
created at the Charles University in Prague. The treebank consists of 87,913
sentences (1.5 M tokens) and its domain is mainly newswire, reaching also to
business and popular scientific articles from the 1990s. The treebank is
licensed under the terms of CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 and its original (non-UD) version
can be downloaded from

http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-097C-0000-0023-1AAF-3.

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Czech UD treebank is created
through a conversion of PDT data. The conversion procedure has been designed by
Dan Zeman.

Due to Github restrictions on file size, the training data has been split into
four files according to the original source. All of them are newspapers, but

* l and m are mainstream daily papers (news, commentaries, but also sports
  results and TV programs)
* c is a business weekly
* v contains popular scientific articles (the hardest to parse: long sentences,
  unusual vocabulary)

The dev and test sets contain all four sources and their size is proportional
to the sizes of the respective training parts.

Changelog

2015-11-15 v1.2
  * Conversion procedure rewritten again (may result in minor differences in
    borderline cases)
  * Only one “root” relation per tree now enforced; some bugs around root fixed
  * The “name” relation goes now always left-to-right (in UD 1.1 it was family-
    to-given name)
  * Fixed bug with numeral-noun swapping that destroyed coordinations of
    numbers and caused the “conj” relation to go right-to-left
  * Fixed minor bugs around subordinating conjunctions
  * Changed dependency relation of reflexive pronouns attached to inherently
    reflexive verbs from compound:reflex to expl
  * Applied heuristics to distinguish at least some iobj from dobj
  * Fixed bugs around xcomp (future infinitives and subjects attached to
    controlled verbs)
2015-05-15 v1.1
  * Conversion procedure completely rewritten
  * Improved heuristics to distinguish DET and PRON
  * Improved treatment of comparative complements (conjunctions “než” and “jako”)
  * Remaining lemma extensions moved from LEMMA to MISC
