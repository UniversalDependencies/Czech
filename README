The Czech UD treebank is based on the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0 (PDT),
created at the Charles University in Prague. The treebank consists of 87,913
sentences (1.5 M tokens) and its domain is mainly newswire, reaching also to
business and popular scientific articles from the 1990s. The treebank is
licensed under the terms of CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 and its original (non-UD) version
can be downloaded from

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Czech UD treebank is created
through a conversion of PDT data. The conversion procedure has been designed by
Dan Zeman.

Due to Github restrictions on file size, the training data has been split into
four files according to the original source. All of them are newspapers, but

* l and m are mainstream daily papers (news, commentaries, but also sports
  results and TV programs)
* c is a business weekly
* v contains popular scientific articles (the hardest to parse: long sentences,
  unusual vocabulary)

The dev and test sets contain all four sources and their size is proportional
to the sizes of the respective training parts.
